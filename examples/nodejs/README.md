# ThumbHash NodeJS Example

<br />

For simplicity, this example uses [Jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) to load and resize images (if necessary). Any other image-processing library might be used instead of it.

After cloning the repo navigate to `examples/nodejs`. Then `npm install` and `node index.js` to run the example script. Output files are saved to this folder.
